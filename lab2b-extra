## Customer: Limits in Waiting

Finally, a customer can get fed up with waiting, and just leaves the shop.  Each customer has a `waitingLimit` time, generated by the class `RandomGenerator` `genWaitingLimit()` method upon the customer arrival.  If the customer does not get served within this limit, he or she will leave the shop.

To implement this behavior, you should introduce a new type of event, a "leave" event, to signify that the customer is leaving the shop. This event should be generated and scheduled when the customer joins a queue.  

Note that when this "leave" event is triggered, the customer might have already been served or is being served, in which case nothing should happen.

How long is the limit is determined by the method `genWaitingLimit()` from the class `RandomGenerator`.  This is a truncated exponential random variable governed by the rate $\omega$, with a minimum value of 1.
