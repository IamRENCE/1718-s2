            "text": "CS2030 Java Style Guide\n\n\nWhy Coding Style is Important\n\n\nOne of the goals of CS2030 is to move you away from the mindset that you are writing code that you will discard after it is done (e.g., in CS1010 labs) and you are writing code that noone else will read except you.  CS2030 prepares you to work in a software engineering teams in many ways, and one of the ways is to enforce a consistent coding style.\n\n\nIf everyone on the team follows the same style, the intend of the programmer can become clear (e.g., is this a class or a field?), the code is more readable and less bug prone (e.g., the \nApple \ngoto fail\n bug\n).  Empirical studies support this:\n\n\n\n\nQuote\n\n\n\"It is not merely a matter of aesthetics that programs should be written in a particular style. Rather there is a psychological basis for writing programs in a conventional manner: programmers have strong expectations that other programmers will follow these discourse rules. If the rules are violated, then the utility afforded by the expectations that programmers have built up over time is effectively nullified. The results from the experiments with novice and advanced student programmers and with professional programmers described in this paper provide clear support for these claims.\"\n\n\nElliot Soloway and Kate Ehrlich. \"Empirical studies of programming knowledge.\" IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 5 (1984): 595-609.\n\n\n\n\nMany major companies enforce coding styles, and some have published them.  For CS2030, we base our (simplified) coding style on \nGoogle's Java Coding Style\n.

CS2030 prepares you to work in a software engineering teams in many ways, and one of the ways is to enforce a consistent coding style.  If everyone on the team follows the same style, the intend of the programmer can become clear (e.g., is this a class or a field?), the code is more readable and less bug prone (e.g., the  Apple  goto fail  bug ).  Empirical studies support this:   Quote  \"It is not merely a matter of aesthetics that programs should be written in a particular style. Rather there is a psychological basis for writing programs in a conventional manner: programmers have strong expectations that other programmers will follow these discourse rules. If the rules are violated, then the utility afforded by the expectations that programmers have built up over time is effectively nullified. The results from the experiments with novice and advanced student programmers and with professional programmers described in this paper provide clear support for these claims.\"  Elliot Soloway and Kate Ehrlich. \"Empirical studies of programming knowledge.\" IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 5 (1984): 595-609.   Many major companies enforce coding styles, and some have published them.  For CS2030, we base our (simplified) coding style on  Google's Java Coding Style .

A \njavadoc\n comments always starts with \n/**\n (not the double asterisks) and ends with \n*/\n and are always placed \nimmediately\n before a class, an interface, a constructor, a method, or field declaration.\n\n\nExample:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n/** \n\n\n * Encapsulates a circle on a 2D plane.

The VM is running CentOS, one of the Linux distributions.\nThis will be the official programming environment for CS2030 for all your lab assignments.\n\n\nI have created your accounts on the VM based on your SoC UNIX account.  You can login with your SoC UNIX username (not your NUSNET username, unless you intentionally set the two to be the same) and password.\n\n\nSoC VPN\n\n\nTHe VM can only be accessed from within the School of Computing networks.  If you want to access it from outside, you need to setup a Virtual Private Network (VPN) (See \ninstruction here\n).  The staff at \nhelpdesk@comp.nus.edu.sg\n or the IT helpdesk in COM1, Level 1, will be able to help with you setting up if needed.\n\n\nSSH\n\n\nFor UNIX-based OS\n\n\nIf you use either macOS, Windows 10 (with bash on Ubuntu), or Linux, you should have the command line \nssh\n installed.  \n\n\nRun:\n\n1\nssh <username>@cs2030-i.comp.nus.edu.sg\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \n<username>\n with your SoC UNIX username, for instance, I would do:\n\n1\nssh ooiwt@cs2030-i.comp.nus.edu.sg\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the command above, following the instructions on screen.  The first time you ever connect to \ncs2030-i.comp.nus.edu.sg\n, you will be warned that you are connecting to a previously unknown host.  Said \nyes\n, and you will be prompted with your SoC UNIX password.\n\n\nFor Windows 7 or 8\n\n\nThe desktop computers in Programming Lab 6 (PL6) runs Windows 7.  If you are using these computers, or your own computers with older versions of Windows, you need to use \nXShell 5\n to access the VM.\n\n\nBasic UNIX Commands\n\n\nOnce you logged into the VM, you will be prompted to enter a command with a prompt that looks like this:\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\nThis interface is provided by a UNIX shell -- not unlike \njshell\n, this shell sits in a loop and wait for users to enter a command, then it interprets and executes the command.  There are many versions of shells, the default shell for our VM is \nbash\n1\n.\n\n\nThe following are adapted for CS2030 from \nthe instructions created by Aaron Tan\n. Bugs are mine.\n  \n\n\nThe power of UNIX stems from the many commands it offers. The following are a few commonly used commands. This list is by no means exhaustive and you are urged to explore on your own. Note that UNIX commands are case-sensitive.\n\n\nIn the examples below, bold words are commands which you are expected to enter. All commands are to be entered after the UNIX (local or \nsunfire\n or \ncs2030-i\n) prompt of the form\n\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n~\n indicates that you are currently in your home directory, \nxxx\n is a number indicating the number of commands that have been entered.  The following examples assumes that user \nhappytan\n is logged into cs2030-i; however you can do it on your local UNIX platform too.\n\n\nIt might be good to understand the directory structure in UNIX, a multi-user system. The directory tree is shown below:\n\n\n\n\nEach user has his/her own home directory, which is where he/she will be automatically placed when he/she logs into the system. The above figure shows where the home directory of user \nhappytan\n resides in the directory tree. The user \nhappytan\n may create files or directories in his/her home directory, but not elsewhere unless permission is given.\n\n\nDirectory commands\n\n\n\n\n\n\npwd\n: Print current Working Directory to show you which directory you are currently in\n\n1\n2\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ pwd\n/home/h/happytan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nls\n: LiSt files in your current directory\n\n1\n2\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ ls\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\n   If you do not have any regular files in your home directory, as you should when you first login, you should immediately return to the shell prompt.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule of Silence\nUNIX follows the \nrule of silence\n: programs should not print unnecessary output, to allow other programs and users to easily parse the output from one program.  So, if \nls\n has nothing to list, it will list nothing (as oppose to, say, printing \"This is an empty directory.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmkdir\n: MaKe a subDIRectory in current directory\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ mkdir lab01\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ ls\nlab01\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ ls -F\nlab01/\n\n\n\n\nHere, you create a directory called \nlab01\n.  Now, when you \nls\n, you can see the directory listed.\nYou may also use \nls -F\n for more information (\n-F\n is one of the many \noptions\n/\nflags\n available for the \nls\n command. To see a complete list of the options, refer to the man pages, i.e., \nman ls\n.)\n\n\nThe slash \n/\n beside the filename tells you that the file is a directory (aka folder in Windows lingo). A normal file does not have a slash beside its name when \"ls -F\" is used.\n\n\nYou may also use the \nls -l\n command (hyphen el, not hyphen one) to display almost all the file information, include the size of the file and the date of modification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand history\n\n\nUNIX maintains a history of your previously executed UNIX commands, and you may use the up and down arrows to go through it. Press the up arrow until you find a previously executed UNIX command. You may then press Enter to execute it, or edit the command before executing it. This is handy when you need to repeatedly executed a long UNIX command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncd\n: Change Directory from current directory to another\n\n1\n2\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ cd lab01\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\nNote that the prompt changes to \n~/lab01\n to indicate that you are now in the \nlab01\n directory below your \nHOME\n directory.\n\n\nEntering \ncd\n alone brings you back to your \nHOME\n directory, i.e.,. the directory in which you started with when you first logged into the system.\n\n1\n2\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ cd\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrmdir\n:  to ReMove a subDIRectory in current directory -- note that a directory must be empty before it can be removed.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ rmdir lab01\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ ls -F\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ mkdir lab01\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ ls -F\nlab01/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile commands\n\n\n\n\ncp\n:  CoPy files\n\n1\n2\n3\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ cp ~cs2030/lab01/Circle.java .\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ ls\nCircle.java\n\n\n\n\nThe command above copy the files Circle.java from the HOME of user \ncs2030\n, under directory \nlab01\n, to the current directory.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to copy the whole directory, use \n-r\n flag, where \nr\n stands for recursive copy.\n\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ cp -r ~cs2030/lab01 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe directory \nlab01\n and everything under it will be copied.\n\n\n\n\nmv\n: MoVe files from one directory to another; can also be used to rename files.\n\n1\n2\n3\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ mv Circle.java Test.java\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ ls\nTest.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilename completion\n\n\nIf you have a very long file name, you may use UNIX's filename completion feature to reduce typing. For instance, you may type:\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ mv C\n\n\n\n\nand press the tab key, and UNIX will complete the filename for you if there is only one filename with the prefix \"C\". Otherwise, it will fill up the filename up to point where you need to type in more characters for disambiguation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrm\n: ReMove files. Be careful with this command -- files deleted cannot be restored (unless they have been backed up during the normal backup cycle).\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ rm Test.java\nrm: remove 'Test.java'? y\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ ls\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand to display text files\n\n\n\n\ncat\n: to string together or display (CATenate) the contents of files onto the screen\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ cat Circle.java\n\n\n\n\n\nless\n - variant of \ncat\n (includes features to read each page leisurely)\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ less Circle.java\n\n\n\n\nIn \nless\n, use \n<space>\n to move down one page, \nb\n to move Back up one page, and \nq\n to Quit from \"less\".\n\n\n\n\nAn online help facility is available in UNIX via the \nman\n command (\nman\n stands for MANual). To look for more information about any UNIX command, for example, \nls\n, type \nman ls\n. Type \nman man\n and refer to Man Pages to find out more about the facility. To exit \nman\n, press \nq\n.\n\n\nNow that you are familiar with how the UNIX shell works, I won't show the command prompt any more in the rest of this article.\n\n\nUNIX File Permission\n\n\nIt is important to guide our files properly on a multi-user system where users share the same file system.  UNIX has a simple mechanism to for ensuring that: every file and directory has nine bits of access permission, corresponds to three access operations, read (\nr\n), write (\nw\n), and execute (\nx\n), for four classes of users, the user who owns of the file (\nu\n), users in the same group as the owner (\ng\n), all other users (\no\n), and all users (\na\n) (union of all three classes before)\n\n\nWhen you run \nls -l\n, you will see the permission encoded as strings that look like \n-rw-------\n or \ndrwx--x--x\n besides other file information.   \n\n\n\n\nThe first character indicates if the file is a directory (\nd\n) or not (\n-\n).  \n\n\nThe next three characters are the permission for the owner.  \nrwx\n means that the owner can do all three: reading, writing, and executing, \nrw-\n means that the owner can read and write, but cannot execute.\n\n\nThe next three characters are the permission for the users in the same group.\n\n\nThe last three characters are the permission for the users in the other groups.\n\n\n\n\nTo change permission, we use the \nchmod\n command.  Let's say that we want to remove the read and write permission from all other users in the group.  You can run:\n\n1\nchmod g-rw <file>\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n<file>\n is the name of the file whose permission you want to change.  This would change the permission from \n-rw-rw-rw-\n to \n-rw----rw-\n, or from \n-rwxr--r--\n to \n-rwx---r--\n.\n\n\nTo add executable permission to everyone, you can run:\n\n1\nchmod a+x <file>\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would change the permission from \n-rw-rw-rw-\n to \n-rwx--xrwx\n, or from \n-rwxr--r--\n to \n-rwx--xr-x\n, and so on.  You get the idea.\n\n\nAnother way to change the permission is set the permission directly, instead of adding with \n+\n and removing with \n-\n.  To do this, one convenient way is to treat the permission for each class of user as a 3-bit binary number between 0 to 7.  So, \nrwx\n is 7, \nrw-\n is 6, \n-w-\n is 2, \n---\n is 0, etc.  \n\n\nTo set the permission of a file to \n-r--r--r--\n (readable by everyone), run:\n\n1\nchmod 444 <file>\n\n\n\n\n\nTo set the permission to \n-rw-------\n, run:\n\n1\nchmod 600 <file>\n\n\n\n\n\nand so on.\n\n\nIt is important to ensure that your code is not readable and writable by other students, especially for graded lab exercises.\n\n\nSecure Copy (\nscp\n)\n\n\nSecure copy, or \nscp\n, is one way to transfer files from your local computer to \ncs2030-i\n.  If you choose not to use \nemacs\n or \nvim\n2\n and write your code on \ncs2030-i\n, you can write your code on your local computer, and transfer them.  Let's say that you are in the directory with a bunch of java files you want to transfer, and you want them transferred into directory \ntest\n that you have created, do the following:\n\n\n1\nscp *.java happytan@cs2030-i:~/test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you have files with the same name in the remote directory, the files will be overwritten without warning.  I have lost my code a few times due to \nscp\n.  \n\n\n\n\nThe expression \n*.java\n is a regular expression that means all files with filename ending with \n.java\n.

Keep the private key \nid_rsa\n on your local machine in the hidden \n~/.ssh\n directory, and copy the public key \nid_rsa.pub\n to your home directory on VM \ncs2030-i\n.  On \ncs2030-i\n, run\n\n1\ncat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the permission for \n.ssh\n both on local machine and on VM is set to \n700\n and the files \nid_rsa\n on local machine and \nauthorized_keys\n on remote machine is set to \n600\n.  Once setup, you need not enter your password every time you run \nssh\n or \nscp\n.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI run \nfish\n on my macOS, as you might have noticed during the in-class demos.  You can use any shell you like, if you know what you are doing.  Otherwise, \nbash\n is a popular one.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy personal opinion is that, you should really master one of these two time-tested source code editor if you want a career in software development.\u00a0\n\u21a9",

There are many versions of shells, the default shell for our VM is  bash 1 .  The following are adapted for CS2030 from  the instructions created by Aaron Tan . Bugs are mine.     The power of UNIX stems from the many commands it offers. The following are a few commonly used commands. This list is by no means exhaustive and you are urged to explore on your own. Note that UNIX commands are case-sensitive.  In the examples below, bold words are commands which you are expected to enter. All commands are to be entered after the UNIX (local or  sunfire  or  cs2030-i ) prompt of the form  1 happytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$   ~  indicates that you are currently in your home directory,  xxx  is a number indicating the number of commands that have been entered.  The following examples assumes that user  happytan  is logged into cs2030-i; however you can do it on your local UNIX platform too.  It might be good to understand the directory structure in UNIX, a multi-user system. The directory tree is shown below:   Each user has his/her own home directory, which is where he/she will be automatically placed when he/she logs into the system. The above figure shows where the home directory of user  happytan  resides in the directory tree.

Rule of Silence UNIX follows the  rule of silence : programs should not print unnecessary output, to allow other programs and users to easily parse the output from one program.

To see a complete list of the options, refer to the man pages, i.e.,  man ls .)  The slash  /  beside the filename tells you that the file is a directory (aka folder in Windows lingo). A normal file does not have a slash beside its name when \"ls -F\" is used.  You may also use the  ls -l  command (hyphen el, not hyphen one) to display almost all the file information, include the size of the file and the date of modification.     Command history  UNIX maintains a history of your previously executed UNIX commands, and you may use the up and down arrows to go through it. Press the up arrow until you find a previously executed UNIX command. You may then press Enter to execute it, or edit the command before executing it. This is handy when you need to repeatedly executed a long UNIX command.     cd : Change Directory from current directory to another 1\n2 happytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ cd lab01\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$  \nNote that the prompt changes to  ~/lab01  to indicate that you are now in the  lab01  directory below your  HOME  directory.

            "text": "It is important to guide our files properly on a multi-user system where users share the same file system.  UNIX has a simple mechanism to for ensuring that: every file and directory has nine bits of access permission, corresponds to three access operations, read ( r ), write ( w ), and execute ( x ), for four classes of users, the user who owns of the file ( u ), users in the same group as the owner ( g ), all other users ( o ), and all users ( a ) (union of all three classes before)  When you run  ls -l , you will see the permission encoded as strings that look like  -rw-------  or  drwx--x--x  besides other file information.      The first character indicates if the file is a directory ( d ) or not ( - ).    The next three characters are the permission for the owner.   rwx  means that the owner can do all three: reading, writing, and executing,  rw-  means that the owner can read and write, but cannot execute.  The next three characters are the permission for the users in the same group.  The last three characters are the permission for the users in the other groups.   To change permission, we use the  chmod  command.  Let's say that we want to remove the read and write permission from all other users in the group.  You can run: 1 chmod g-rw <file>   where  <file>  is the name of the file whose permission you want to change.  This would change the permission from  -rw-rw-rw-  to  -rw----rw- , or from  -rwxr--r--  to  -rwx---r-- .  To add executable permission to everyone, you can run: 1 chmod a+x <file>   This would change the permission from  -rw-rw-rw-  to  -rwx--xrwx , or from  -rwxr--r--  to  -rwx--xr-x , and so on.  You get the idea.  Another way to change the permission is set the permission directly, instead of adding with  +  and removing with  - .  To do this, one convenient way is to treat the permission for each class of user as a 3-bit binary number between 0 to 7.  So,  rwx  is 7,  rw-  is 6,  -w-  is 2,  ---  is 0, etc.    To set the permission of a file to  -r--r--r--  (readable by everyone), run: 1 chmod 444 <file>   To set the permission to  -rw------- , run: 1 chmod 600 <file>   and so on.

Prefix it with a number \n\\(n\\)\n to undo \n\\(n\\)\n times.  If you regreted your undo, \n<CTRL-R>\n will redo.\n\n\nSyntax Highlighting\n\n\nIf for some reasons, syntax highlighting is not on by default, add this to your \n~/.vimrc\n:\n\n\n1\nsyntax on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuler and Numbers\n\n\nIf you prefer to show the line number you are on and the column number you are on, adding the commands to \n~/.vimrc\n\n\n1\nset ruler\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill display the line number and the column number on the lower right corner.  \n\n\nYou can also add\n\n1\nset number\n\n\n\n\n\nto label each line with a line number.\n\n\nJumping to a Line\n\n\nIf the compiler tells you there is an error on Line \n\\(x\\)\n, you can issue \n:<x>\n to jump to Line \n\\(x\\)\n.  For instance, \n:40\n will go to Line 40.\n\n\nShell Command\n\n\nIf you need to issue a shell command quickly, you don't have to exit \nvim\n, run the command, and launch \nvim\n again.
